# `how` - Lightweight AI assistant for your CLI

Enter **`how`** – the slick, AI-powered sidekick that turns your "WTF do I type?" moments into commands. Built in Go for speed, this cross-platform tool taps OpenRouter.ai's API to generate commands via top LLMs (even free ones!).

## Features
- ⚡ Blazing fast and dependency-free.
- 🌐 Runs on Linux, macOS, Windows.
- 💸 Free models by default—no cost to start.

## Usage
Ask away:
```bash
$ how find all files named docker-compose.yml
find . -type f -name "docker-compose.yml"

$ how check memory usage in a human readable format
free -h

$ how kill process on port 8080
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
```

**Pro Tip**: Override the model with `--model "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"` or set a default via `how set-model`. Defaults to `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free`.

## Install

### Download Pre-built Binary (Recommended)
Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/patrykgruszka/how-cli/releases):

1. Download the archive for your OS/architecture
2. Extract the binary:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   tar -xzf how-v*.tar.gz
   
   # Windows
   # Extract the .zip file
   ```
3. Move to your PATH:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   sudo mv how /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Windows
   # Move how.exe to a directory in your PATH
   ```

### Arch Linux (AUR)
For Arch Linux users, install via AUR:
```bash
yay -S how-cli
```

### Build from Source
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patrykgruszka/how-cli.git
   cd how-cli
   ```
2. Run the installer (handles build and PATH):
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

**Alternatives**: Build manually with `go build` or use `make install`. For cross-platform binaries, run `make cross` (outputs to `dist/`).

## Setup
Grab a free API key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys), then:
```bash
how setup
```
Paste your key—it's stored securely in `~/.config/how/config.yaml` (or equivalent on Windows).

## Config & More
Tweak your config file if needed (e.g., for a custom default model). For dev builds or contributions:
- `make build` for local.
